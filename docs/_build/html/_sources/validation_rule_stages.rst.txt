Validation rule stages
======================

Validation rule stages can be used to summarize the number of validation
rule violations for a given duration and validation rule group.

Defining a new validation rule stage
------------------------------------

To define a new stage, press the *DQ monitor* link in the left menu, and
then click *New validation rule stage*. You will be presented with a form
to fill in the details of the validation rule stage.

The form consists of the following fields:

``Stage name``
   The name of the validation rule stage.

``Org unit level``
   This is the level where the validation rule analysis will be started.
   You may need to experiment with this setting to find the best fit for
   your data. The validation rule analysis will be performed on all org
   units at the specified level and below. If you set the level to 1, a
   single request will be made to the DHIS2 API for all org units. This
   may result in a set of results which is too large to be returned by
   the API. If you set the level to 2, the validation rule analysis will
   make a request for each org unit at level 2 (including all of its
   children). Thus, you can set the org unit level at a lower level to
   increase the number of requests made to the DHIS2 API (which in turn
   should reduce the overall number of individual validation rule
   results returned), but this will also increase the time it takes to
   run the validation rule analysis.

``Duration``
   The duration of the validation rule stage. This is used to determine
   the start and end dates of the validation rule analysis relative to
   the current date. The duration can be specified in days, weeks,
   months, or years with the format ``12 months``, ``3 weeks``,
   ``7 days``, etc.

``Validation rule group``
   The validation rule group to use for the validation rule analysis. All
   validation rules in the group will be used to determine the number of
   validation rule violations.

``Period type``
   The period type to store the validation rule violations in. As an
   example, if you choose ``Monthly``, the validation rule counts will be
   stored in the current month. If you run the stage on a nightly basis,
   this will have the effect of overwriting the current value each day.
   However, if you choose ``Daily``, the validation rule counts will be
   stored in the current day. If you schedule the stage to run on a daily
   basis, this will result in a new value being stored each day, allowing
   you to track the number of validation rule violations over time on a
   more granular level than the monthly period type.

``Destination data element``
   The data element used to store the number of validation rule
   violations detected by the validation rule stage.

``Active``
   Whether the validation rule stage is active or not. If the validation
   rule stage is not active, it will be excluded when running the
   validation rule analysis with the command line script.
